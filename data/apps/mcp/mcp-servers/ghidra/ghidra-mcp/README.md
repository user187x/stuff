A production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges Ghidra's powerful reverse engineering capabilities with modern AI tools and automation frameworks. **253 MCP tools**, battle-tested AI workflows, and the most comprehensive Ghidra-MCP integration available — now including P-code emulation, live debugger integration, and PCode-graph data flow analysis.

## Why Ghidra MCP?

Most Ghidra MCP implementations give you a handful of read-only tools and call it a day. This project is different — it was built by a reverse engineer who uses it daily on real binaries, not as a demo.

- **253 MCP tools** — 3x more than any competing implementation. Not just read operations — full write access for renaming, typing, commenting, structure creation, script execution, P-code emulation, and live debugging.
- **Battle-tested AI workflows** — Proven documentation workflows (V5) refined across hundreds of functions. Includes step-by-step prompts, Hungarian notation reference, batch processing guides, and orphaned code discovery.
- **Production-grade reliability** — Atomic transactions, batch operations (93% API call reduction), configurable timeouts, and graceful error handling. No silent failures.
- **Cross-binary documentation transfer** — SHA-256 function hash matching propagates documentation across binary versions automatically. Document once, apply everywhere.
- **Full Ghidra Server integration** — Connect to shared Ghidra servers, manage repositories, version control, checkout/checkin workflows, and multi-user collaboration.
- **Headless and GUI modes** — Run with or without the Ghidra GUI. Docker-ready for CI/CD pipelines and automated analysis at scale.
- **Opinionated by design** — v5.0 moves naming conventions, type safety, and documentation standards into the tool layer. AI agents and human engineers produce consistent output without style guides in every prompt.

## Convention Enforcement

You've been there: six months into a project you find `ProcessItem`, `process_items`, `handleItem`, and `ItemProc` in the same codebase — four functions doing the same thing, named by four different sessions or engineers with no shared contract. Fixing it takes longer than it should, and the problem will happen again.

v5.0 moves conventions from "things to remember" into the tool layer, where they can actually be enforced.

| Tier | Behavior | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Auto-fix** | Applied silently | `count` field on a `uint32` → auto-prefixed `dwCount` on save |
| **Warn** | Change goes through, warning returned | `processData` → "name should be PascalCase with a verb: `ProcessData`" |
| **Reject** | Change blocked with explanation | `undefined → undefined` type change → "no-op rejected, type unchanged" |

**For AI agents**, this means consistent output across every session, every model, every run — without pasting a style guide into every prompt. The tool knows the rules; the model just needs to make the call.

**For teams**, it eliminates the entire class of review comment that says "that's not our naming convention." Convention arbitration stays in the tool, not in code review.

**For solo work at scale**, `analyze_function_completeness` gives you a 0–100% score that measures honestly: structural deductions (unfixable compiler artifacts) are forgiven in your effective score, log-scaling prevents one bad category from burying everything else, and tiered plate comment quality means you know exactly what's missing and why.

## 🌟 Features

### Core MCP Integration
- **Full MCP Compatibility** — Complete implementation of Model Context Protocol
- **253 MCP tools** — Comprehensive API surface covering every aspect of binary analysis
- **Production-Ready Reliability** — Atomic transactions, batch operations, configurable timeouts
- **Real-time Analysis** — Live integration with Ghidra's analysis engine

> **Compatibility note:** MCP tool names are normalized for GitHub Copilot CLI
> and CAPI validation. Exposed tool names use lowercase letters, digits,
> underscores, and hyphens only; nested HTTP paths such as `/debugger/status`
> are advertised as names like `debugger_status_2` when needed to avoid
> collisions with static bridge tools.

### Binary Analysis Capabilities
- **Function Analysis** — Decompilation, call graphs, cross-references, completeness scoring
- **Data Flow Analysis** — PCode-graph value propagation (forward / backward) from any variable or register
- **Data Structure Discovery** — Struct/union/enum creation with field analysis and naming suggestions
- **String Extraction** — Regex search, quality filtering, and string-anchored function discovery
- **Import/Export Analysis** — Symbol tables, external locations, ordinal import resolution
- **Memory & Data Inspection** — Raw memory reads, byte pattern search, array boundary detection
- **Cross-Binary Documentation** — Function hash matching and documentation propagation across versions

### Dynamic Analysis (v5.4.0)
- **P-code Emulation** — Run any function in isolation via Ghidra's `EmulatorHelper`; brute-force API hash resolution in milliseconds
- **Live Debugger Integration** — 17 Java endpoints + 22 Python bridge tools over Ghidra's TraceRmi framework (dbgeng on Windows PE, gdb/lldb otherwise): attach, step, breakpoints, registers, memory reads, non-breaking function tracing, ASLR-aware static↔dynamic address translation

### AI-Powered Reverse Engineering Workflows
- **Function Documentation Workflow V5** — 7-step process for complete function documentation with Hungarian notation, type auditing, and automated verification scoring
- **Batch Documentation** — Parallel subagent dispatch for documenting multiple functions simultaneously
- **Orphaned Code Discovery** — Automated scanner finds undiscovered functions in gaps between known code
- **Data Type Investigation** — Systematic workflows for structure discovery and field analysis
- **Cross-Version Matching** — Hash-based function matching across different binary versions

### Development & Automation
- **Ghidra Script Management** — Create, run, update, and delete Ghidra scripts entirely via MCP
- **Multi-Program Support** — Switch between and compare multiple open programs
- **Batch Operations** — Bulk renaming, commenting, typing, and label management (93% fewer API calls)
- **Headless Server** — Full analysis without Ghidra GUI — Docker and CI/CD ready
- **Project & Version Control** — Create projects, manage files, Ghidra Server integration
- **Analysis Control** — List, configure, and trigger Ghidra analyzers programmatically

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21 LTS** (OpenJDK recommended)
- **Apache Maven 3.9+**
- **Ghidra 12.1.2** (or compatible version)
- **Python 3.10+** with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip + venv

> Shared Ghidra Server users: Ghidra 12.1.2 clients require a Ghidra
> Server at 12.1, 12.0.5, or a newer compatible version. Upgrade the
> server before using this plugin from a 12.1 client.
>
> Ghidra 12.1.2 ships Jython as an optional extension. Java scripts work
> by default, but `.py` scripts in `ghidra_scripts/` require installing
> the Jython extension from **File > Install Extensions** and restarting
> Ghidra.

### Installation

> Recommended for all platforms: use `python -m tools.setup` directly.
>
> `ensure-prereqs` installs runtime Python requirements plus the Ghidra JARs needed in the local Maven repository.
> `deploy` copies the build output, installs the user-profile extension, and patches Ghidra user config.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp.git
   cd ghidra-mcp
   ```

2. **Recommended: run environment preflight first:**
   ```text
   python -m tools.setup preflight --ghidra-path "F:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"
   ```

3. **Build and deploy to Ghidra:**
   ```text
   python -m tools.setup ensure-prereqs --ghidra-path "F:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"
   python -m tools.setup build
   python -m tools.setup deploy --ghidra-path "F:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"
   ```

   `deploy` saves/closes an already-running matching Ghidra instance when
   needed, installs the extension, starts Ghidra, waits for MCP health, and runs
   schema smoke checks.

4. **Optional strict/manual mode** (advanced):
   ```text
   # Skip automatic prerequisite setup
   python -m tools.setup build
   python -m tools.setup deploy --ghidra-path "F:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"
   ```

5. **Show command help**:
   ```text
   python -m tools.setup --help
   ```

6. **Optional build-only mode** (advanced/troubleshooting):
   ```text
   python -m tools.setup build
   ```

   Supported build path: `python -m tools.setup build` uses Maven under the hood and is the canonical workflow used by the repo tasks and docs.

   ```bash
   # Manual Maven build (requires Ghidra deps already installed in local .m2)
   mvn clean package assembly:single -DskipTests
   ```

   ```bash
   # Secondary/manual Gradle build path only (not used by tools.setup or VS Code tasks)
   GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/ghidra gradle buildExtension
   ```

### Installation (Linux — Ubuntu/Debian)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp.git
   cd ghidra-mcp
   ```

2. **Install system prerequisites** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y openjdk-21-jdk maven python3 python3-pip python3-venv curl jq unzip
   ```

   > **Debian/Kali/Ubuntu 23.04+ note (PEP 668):** these distros mark the system
   > Python as *externally managed*, so a bare `pip install` fails with
   > `error: externally-managed-environment`. Don't work around it with
   > `--break-system-packages` — it can corrupt apt-managed tooling. Instead use
   > [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended — it creates and manages a
   > project-local `.venv` automatically, and is what this repo's commands use):
   > ```bash
   > curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   > uv run bridge-mcp-ghidra    # resolves deps into .venv and starts the bridge
   > ```
   > or a classic virtual environment:
   > ```bash
   > python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   > pip install -e .
   > bridge-mcp-ghidra
   > ```

3. **Run environment preflight:**
   ```bash
   python -m tools.setup preflight --ghidra-path ~/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC
   ```

4. **Build and deploy to Ghidra (single command):**
   ```bash
   python -m tools.setup ensure-prereqs --ghidra-path ~/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC
   python -m tools.setup build
   python -m tools.setup deploy --ghidra-path ~/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC
   ```

   This will:
   - Install Ghidra JAR dependencies into your local `~/.m2/repository`
   - Build `GhidraMCP-<version>.zip` with Maven
   - Extract the extension to `~/.config/ghidra/ghidra_<version>_PUBLIC/Extensions/`
   - Update `preferences` with `LastExtensionImportDirectory`
   - Install Python requirements

5. **Optional: setup only Maven dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m tools.setup install-ghidra-deps --ghidra-path ~/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC
   ```

6. **Show command help:**
   ```bash
   python -m tools.setup --help
   ```

> **Linux paths:** The extension is installed to `$HOME/.config/ghidra/ghidra_<version>_PUBLIC/Extensions/GhidraMCP/`.
> Ghidra config files are in `$HOME/.config/ghidra/ghidra_<version>_PUBLIC/`.

### Installation (macOS — Homebrew)

1. **Install prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   brew install openjdk@21 maven python ghidra
   ```

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp.git
   cd ghidra-mcp
   ```

3. **Install Ghidra JARs into local Maven:**
   ```bash
    python -m tools.setup install-ghidra-deps \
       --ghidra-path /opt/homebrew/opt/ghidra/libexec
   ```

4. **Build and deploy:**
   ```bash
    python -m tools.setup ensure-prereqs \
       --ghidra-path /opt/homebrew/opt/ghidra/libexec
    python -m tools.setup build
    python -m tools.setup deploy \
       --ghidra-path /opt/homebrew/opt/ghidra/libexec
   ```
   The extension is installed to `~/Library/ghidra/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC/Extensions/GhidraMCP/`.

   > **Note:** `--ghidra-version` is required when using the Homebrew path because the path contains no version string.

5. **Start Ghidra and enable the plugin:**
   ```bash
   /opt/homebrew/opt/ghidra/libexec/ghidraRun
   ```
   In the main project window: **Tools > GhidraMCP > Start MCP Server**

6. **Configure Cursor/Claude MCP** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "ghidra": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/ghidra-mcp", "bridge-mcp-ghidra"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Installation (Arch Linux — AUR)

[@Pandoriaantje](https://github.com/Pandoriaantje) maintains community AUR packages:

- [`ghidra-mcp-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ghidra-mcp-git) — tracks `main`
- [`ghidra-mcp`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ghidra-mcp) — tracks tagged releases

Install with your AUR helper of choice, e.g.:

```bash
yay -S ghidra-mcp        # or ghidra-mcp-git
```

### Basic Usage

#### Option 1: Stdio Transport (Recommended for AI tools)
```bash
uv run bridge-mcp-ghidra          # or: python -m bridge_mcp_ghidra
```

To add the bridge to [Autohand Code](https://github.com/autohandai/code-cli/) from a cloned checkout:

```bash
autohand mcp add ghidra uv run --directory /path/to/ghidra-mcp bridge-mcp-ghidra
```

Add `--scope project` before `ghidra` to save the server in the current project's `.autohand` configuration instead of your user configuration.

#### Option 2: Streamable HTTP Transport (Recommended for web/HTTP clients)
```bash
uv run bridge-mcp-ghidra --transport streamable-http --mcp-host 127.0.0.1 --mcp-port 8081
```

MCP client config for the HTTP transport (add to your client's MCP config file):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ghidra-mcp-http": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8081/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Browser-based clients (e.g. [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector))
work out of the box: the HTTP transports answer CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests and expose
the `mcp-session-id` / `mcp-protocol-version` headers to scripts. Allowed origins mirror the
Host-header policy — loopback on any port is always permitted, plus the bind host and any
hosts listed in `GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

#### Option 3: SSE Transport (Deprecated — use streamable-http instead)
```bash
uv run bridge-mcp-ghidra --transport sse --mcp-host 127.0.0.1 --mcp-port 8081
```

#### Bridge advanced flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--transport` | `stdio` | `stdio` (AI tools), `streamable-http` (web clients), `sse` (deprecated) |
| `--mcp-host` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind host for HTTP transports |
| `--mcp-port` | — | Port for HTTP transports |
| `--lazy` | off | Load only the default tool groups on connect. Faster startup, but MCP clients that don't support `tools/list_changed` will see an incomplete tool list. Not recommended for Claude Code. |
| `--no-lazy` | (default) | Load all tool groups immediately on connect. Required for most AI clients. |
| `--default-groups` | `listing,function,program` | Comma-separated groups loaded on connect when `--lazy` is set. |

#### Strict program routing (multi-program safety)

Set `GHIDRA_MCP_REQUIRE_PROGRAM_SELECTORS=1` to make the bridge refuse any program-scoped
call that omits a program selector, returning a clear error instead of letting the call
ride the server's shared "current program" (the one `switch_program` and the
active GUI tab move).

```bash
export GHIDRA_MCP_REQUIRE_PROGRAM_SELECTORS=1
uv run bridge-mcp-ghidra
```

Without this, a call that leaves `program=` out runs against whichever program
is current, which is fine for a single-program workflow but a hazard once
several programs are open: the call can read or edit the wrong binary with no
error. The hazard is worse when more than one client shares a server, since
each one moves that current-program global out from under the others.

With strict mode on, every program-scoped call must name its target. This
covers every selector that picks an open program: plain `program=` and the
cross-program tools' `source_program`/`target_program` or `program_a`/`program_b`
(declared required, but the server still falls back to the current program when
one arrives empty). A forgotten selector surfaces as a loud error on the first
bad call instead of a silent write to the wrong binary. Tools with no program
selector (`open_program` and `close_program` take `path`/`name`) are unaffected.
Off by default: with the variable unset the bridge sends calls unchanged.

#### Reducing tool-context overhead

The bridge exposes a large catalog. To keep the model's tool surface small, run
with `--lazy` (loads only `listing,function,program` on connect) and let the
model **discover** the rest on demand instead of registering everything:

- `search_tools("rename function")` — keyword-search the **entire** catalog,
  including tools whose group isn't loaded. Each result says whether it's
  callable now and, if not, the exact `load_tool_group(...)` call to enable it.
- `list_tool_groups()` — list all categories and their load state.
- `load_tool_group("datatype")` / `unload_tool_group("datatype")` — load or
  drop a category at runtime.
- `check_tools("rename_symbol,batch_set_comments")` — confirm specific tools
  are callable right now.

`search_tools` works in both eager and `--lazy` modes, so agents that honor
`tools/list_changed` get full discovery without the upfront context cost.

#### Optional: Connect a standalone debugger server

The debugger server itself moved to the `d2-game-exe` repository on 2026-08-11
(its D2 calling-convention layer made it game-specific). Start it there, then
point this bridge at it:

```bash
export GHIDRA_DEBUGGER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8099
```

The bridge's 22 `debugger_*` proxy tools register only when that variable is
set, so leaving it unset costs nothing — the tools simply do not appear rather
than appearing and failing.

Debugger server flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--port` | `8099` | HTTP server port |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (`0.0.0.0` to expose on LAN) |
| `--exports-dir` | — | Path to a `dll_exports/` directory for ordinal-to-name resolution |
| `--log-level` | `INFO` | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR` |

Set `GHIDRA_DEBUGGER_URL` in `.env` if you change the default port or host so the bridge can find it.

#### In Ghidra
1. Start Ghidra and open a **CodeBrowser** window
2. In **CodeBrowser**, enable the plugin via **File > Configure > Configure All Plugins > GhidraMCP**
3. Optional: configure custom port via **CodeBrowser > Edit > Tool Options > GhidraMCP HTTP Server**
4. Start the server via **Tools > GhidraMCP > Start MCP Server**
5. The server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8089/` by default

#### Verify It's Working
```bash
# Quick health check
curl http://127.0.0.1:8089/check_connection
# Expected: "Connected: GhidraMCP plugin running with program '<name>'"

# Get version info
curl http://127.0.0.1:8089/get_version
```

- Company support helps prioritize long-term reliability for the bridge, headless server, debugger integration, and workflow tooling.

## 🔒 Security

GhidraMCP is designed for **localhost-only development**. The default configuration — HTTP server bound to `127.0.0.1`, no authentication — is safe on a trusted single-user workstation and matches pre-v5.4.1 behavior.

**If you expose the server beyond loopback, configure these three environment variables first.** The server refuses to start on a non-loopback bind without a token.

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GHIDRA_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | When set, every HTTP request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Timing-safe comparison. `/mcp/health`, `/health`, `/check_connection` are exempt. |
| `GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOW_SCRIPTS` | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to enable `/run_script_inline` and `/run_ghidra_script`. **Off by default as of v5.4.1** — these endpoints execute arbitrary Java against the Ghidra process. In headless mode this also triggers OSGi `BundleHost` initialization at server startup (Felix framework, ~hundreds of ms); leave it off if you don't need script execution. |
| `GHIDRA_MCP_FILE_ROOT` | When set to a directory path, filesystem-path endpoints (`/load_program`, `/import_file`, `/open_project`, `/delete_file`, etc.) canonicalize the input and require it to fall under this root. Prevents path-traversal. |

Name-quality enforcement is separate from security. By default,
`rename_function` and global write endpoints reject names that fail
the built-in quality gates, and struct field writes apply the built-in field
prefix convention. Disable the built-in convention layer with **Edit > Tool
Options > GhidraMCP HTTP Server > Strict Naming Enforcement**. The same Tool
Options checkbox covers `rename_symbol` (all symbol kinds),
`set_global`, the `apply_data_type` prefix/type guard, and struct-field
Hungarian prefix auto-fixes in `create_struct`, `add_struct_field`, and
`modify_struct_field`. The setting is read when the MCP server starts or
restarts. Function/global convention warnings are still returned when
enforcement is disabled.

### Example: exposing to a private LAN with auth

```bash
export GHIDRA_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOW_SCRIPTS=1     # only if your workflow needs it
export GHIDRA_MCP_FILE_ROOT=/srv/ghidra/inputs

java -jar GhidraMCPHeadless.jar --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 8089
```

### Ghidra Server authentication

When connecting to a shared Ghidra Server, GhidraMCP can suppress the password dialog automatically. It resolves credentials in this order (first non-empty value wins):

Compatibility note: Ghidra 12.1.2 clients require Ghidra Server 12.1.2,
12.0.5, or a newer compatible server. Older shared servers are not safe
targets for a 12.1 client upgrade.

1. `GHIDRA_SERVER_PASSWORD` environment variable (or `.env` file in the Ghidra install directory or `~`)
2. `~/.ghidra-cred` — single-line password file in your home directory
3. `<ghidra-install-dir>/.ghidra-cred`

Username resolves similarly: `GHIDRA_SERVER_USER` env var → `user.name` system property.

If no password is found, Ghidra shows its normal GUI prompt. Set these in `.env` (see `.env.template` for the full block) to enable silent auth.

### Migration from v5.4.0 → v5.4.1

- **Script endpoints now default-off.** If you relied on `/run_script_inline` or `/run_ghidra_script`, export `GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOW_SCRIPTS=1`. This is a deliberate breaking change; the prior default was unsafe.
- **Localhost-only deployments need no changes.** Auth, bind refusal, and path-root checks are all opt-in.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "GhidraMCP" menu not appearing in Tools

**Cause:** Plugin not enabled or installed incorrectly.

**Solution:**
1. Verify extension is installed: **File > Install Extensions** — GhidraMCP should be listed
2. Enable the plugin: **File > Configure > Configure All Plugins > GhidraMCP** (check the box)
3. **Restart Ghidra** after installation/enabling

### Server not responding / Connection refused

**Cause:** Server not started or wrong port.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you started the server: **Tools > GhidraMCP > Start MCP Server**
2. Check configured port: **Edit > Tool Options > GhidraMCP HTTP Server**
3. Check if port is in use:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   lsof -i :8089
   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :8089
   ```
4. Look for errors in Ghidra console: **Window > Console**

### `pip install` fails with `error: externally-managed-environment`

**Cause:** PEP 668. Debian-family distros (Debian 12+, Kali, Ubuntu 23.04+)
mark the system Python as externally managed, so global `pip install` is
blocked to protect apt-managed packages.

**Solution:** Use a virtual environment — never `--break-system-packages`.
The recommended path is [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which manages a
project-local `.venv` automatically:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
cd ghidra-mcp
uv run bridge-mcp-ghidra
```

Or a classic venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
bridge-mcp-ghidra
```

### The `debugger_*` tools do not appear

**Cause:** They are registered only when `GHIDRA_DEBUGGER_URL` is set, and only
on Windows. The debugger server they proxy to lives in the `d2-game-exe`
repository since 2026-08-11 — this repo ships the proxies, not the server.

**Solution:** start the debugger server from that repo, then set the URL before
launching the bridge:

```text
export GHIDRA_DEBUGGER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8099
```

A `ModuleNotFoundError` for `pybag` or `comtypes` while starting that server is
a missing optional dependency on its side; install its Windows-only extras from
that repo, and make sure you install into and run from the same interpreter.

### 500 Internal Server Errors

**Cause:** Server-side exception, often due to missing program data.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure a binary is loaded in CodeBrowser
2. Run auto-analysis first: **Analysis > Auto Analyze**
3. Check Ghidra console (**Window > Console**) for Java exceptions
4. Some operations require fully analyzed binaries

### 404 Not Found Errors

**Cause:** Endpoint doesn't exist or wrong URL.

**Solution:**
1. Verify endpoint exists: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8089/get_version`
2. Check for typos in endpoint name
3. Ensure you're using correct HTTP method (GET vs POST)

### Python Ghidra scripts fail with "No script provider found"

**Cause:** In Ghidra 12.1.2, Jython support is no longer enabled by
default. `.py` scripts need the bundled Jython extension; Python 3
scripts should use PyGhidra instead of the Ghidra Script Manager.

**Solution:**
1. In the Ghidra Front End, open **File > Install Extensions**.
2. Check **Jython**, restart Ghidra, then refresh Script Manager.
3. For new automation, prefer Java Ghidra scripts or PyGhidra.

### Extension not appearing in Install Extensions

**Cause:** JAR file in wrong location.

**Solution:**
1. Manual install location: `~/.ghidra/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC/Extensions/GhidraMCP/lib/GhidraMCP.jar`
2. Or use: **File > Install Extensions > Add** and select the ZIP file
3. Ensure JAR/ZIP was built for your Ghidra version

### Build fails with "Ghidra dependencies not found"

**Cause:** Ghidra JARs not installed in local Maven repository.

**Solution:**
```text
# Windows (recommended)
python -m tools.setup install-ghidra-deps --ghidra-path "C:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"
```

### Components

- **python/bridge_mcp_ghidra/** — Python MCP server package (ships as the `ghidra-mcp-bridge` wheel; `bridge-mcp-ghidra` console script) that translates MCP protocol to HTTP calls (225 catalog entries)
- **GhidraMCP.jar** — Ghidra plugin that exposes analysis capabilities via HTTP (175 GUI endpoints)
- **GhidraMCPHeadlessServer** — Standalone headless server — 183 endpoints, no GUI required
- **ghidra_scripts/** — Collection of automation scripts for common tasks

## 🔧 Development

### Building from Source
```bash
# Recommended: direct Python-first workflow
python -m tools.setup ensure-prereqs --ghidra-path "C:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"
python -m tools.setup build
python -m tools.setup deploy --ghidra-path "C:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"

# Version bump (updates all maintained version references atomically)
python -m tools.setup bump-version --new X.Y.Z
```

The authoritative build system today is Maven. `tools.setup`, the VS Code tasks, and the documented deploy flow all build through `pom.xml` and write artifacts to `target/`. `build.gradle` remains in the repo as a manual fallback for direct Ghidra/Gradle users, but it is not the primary path.

### Command Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ensure-prereqs` | Install Python deps + Ghidra Maven JARs in one shot. Start here on a new machine. |
| `preflight` | Validate Python, build tool, Ghidra path, and JAR availability without making changes. Add `--strict` to also check network reachability. |
| `build` | Build the plugin JAR and extension ZIP via Maven (or Gradle when `TOOLS_SETUP_BACKEND=gradle`). |
| `deploy` | Copy the built extension into the Ghidra profile and patch `FrontEndTool.xml` for auto-activation. |
| `start-ghidra` | Launch the configured Ghidra installation. |
| `clean` | Remove Maven/Gradle build outputs (`target/`, `build/`). |
| `clean-all` | Remove build outputs plus local cache artifacts (`.m2` Ghidra JARs, etc.). |
| `install-ghidra-deps` | Install only the Ghidra JARs into `~/.m2`. Useful when the build environment changes. |
| `install-python-deps` | Install the Python dependency groups via `uv sync`. |
| `run-tests` | Run the Java offline test suite (no live Ghidra needed). |
| `verify-version` | Check that version strings are consistent across `pom.xml`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `README.md`. |
| `bump-version --new X.Y.Z` | Atomically update all version references. Pass `--tag` to create a git tag. |

Common flags accepted by most commands:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--ghidra-path PATH` | Ghidra installation directory. Defaults to `GHIDRA_PATH` from `.env`. |
| `--dry-run` | Print actions without executing them. |
| `--force` | Reinstall Ghidra JARs even if already present (`install-ghidra-deps`, `ensure-prereqs`). |
| `--with-debugger` | Force-install debugger Python requirements (Windows only). |
| `--use-debugger-toggle` | Read `INSTALL_DEBUGGER_DEPS` from `.env` to decide whether to install debugger deps. |
| `--test TIER` | (`deploy` only) Opt into live deploy regression tiers such as `release` or `debugger-live`. |
| `--strict` | (`preflight` only) Also check network reachability for Maven Central and PyPI. |

Deploy test tiers are opt-in because benchmark tiers can import/reset
`Benchmark.dll` and `BenchmarkDebug.exe` in the active Ghidra project. Use
`--test release` before cutting releases, or set
`GHIDRA_MCP_DEPLOY_TESTS=release` in a local `.env` when you want every deploy
on your machine to run the live benchmark regression. See
[Testing and Release Regression](docs/TESTING.md).

### Library Dependencies

Ghidra JARs must be installed into your local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`) before compilation.
This is a one-time setup per machine, and again when your Ghidra version changes.
`-Deploy` now installs these automatically by default.

The tool enforces version consistency between:
- `pom.xml` (`ghidra.version`)
- `--ghidra-path` version segment (e.g., `ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC`)

If these do not match, deployment fails fast with a clear error.

### Troubleshooting: Version Mismatch

If you see a version mismatch error, align both values:
1. `pom.xml` → `ghidra.version`
2. `--ghidra-path` version segment (`ghidra_X.Y.Z_PUBLIC`)

Then rerun:

```text
python -m tools.setup preflight --ghidra-path "C:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"
```

```text
# Windows
python -m tools.setup install-ghidra-deps --ghidra-path "C:\path\to\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC"
```

**Required Libraries (14 JARs, ~37MB):**

| Library | Source Path | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Base.jar** | `Features/Base/lib/` | Core Ghidra functionality |
| **Decompiler.jar** | `Features/Decompiler/lib/` | Decompilation engine |
| **PDB.jar** | `Features/PDB/lib/` | Microsoft PDB symbol support |
| **FunctionID.jar** | `Features/FunctionID/lib/` | Function identification |
| **SoftwareModeling.jar** | `Framework/SoftwareModeling/lib/` | Program model API |
| **Project.jar** | `Framework/Project/lib/` | Project management |
| **Docking.jar** | `Framework/Docking/lib/` | UI docking framework |
| **Generic.jar** | `Framework/Generic/lib/` | Generic utilities |
| **Utility.jar** | `Framework/Utility/lib/` | Core utilities |
| **Gui.jar** | `Framework/Gui/lib/` | GUI components |
| **FileSystem.jar** | `Framework/FileSystem/lib/` | File system support |
| **Graph.jar** | `Framework/Graph/lib/` | Graph/call graph analysis |
| **DB.jar** | `Framework/DB/lib/` | Database operations |
| **Emulation.jar** | `Framework/Emulation/lib/` | P-code emulation |

> **Note**: Libraries are NOT included in the repository (see `.gitignore`). You must install them from your Ghidra installation before building.

> **Automation entry point**:
> - `python -m tools.setup` is the supported setup/build/deploy/versioning interface
> - use `ensure-prereqs`, `build`, `deploy`, `preflight`, `clean-all`, and `bump-version` directly
> - these commands currently use Maven as the canonical Java build backend

### Development Features
- **Automated Deployment**: Version-aware deployment script
- **Batch Operations**: Reduces API calls by 93%
- **Atomic Transactions**: All-or-nothing semantics
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug and trace capabilities

## 🐳 Headless Server (Docker)

GhidraMCP includes a headless server mode for automated analysis without the Ghidra GUI.

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Build and run
docker-compose up -d ghidra-mcp

# Test connection
curl http://localhost:8089/check_connection
# Connection OK - GhidraMCP Headless Server v7.0.0
```

### Headless API Workflow

```bash
# 1. Load a binary
curl -X POST -d "file=/data/program.exe" http://localhost:8089/load_program

# 2. Run auto-analysis (identifies functions, strings, data types)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8089/run_analysis

# 3. List discovered functions
curl "http://localhost:8089/list_functions?limit=20"

# 4. Decompile a function
curl "http://localhost:8089/decompile_function?address=0x401000"

# 5. Get metadata
curl http://localhost:8089/get_metadata
```

### Key Headless Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/load_program` | POST | Load binary file for analysis |
| `/run_analysis` | POST | Run Ghidra auto-analysis |
| `/list_functions` | GET | List all discovered functions |
| `/list_exports` | GET | List exported symbols |
| `/list_imports` | GET | List imported symbols |
| `/decompile_function` | GET | Decompile function to C code |
| `/create_function` | POST | Create function at address |
| `/get_metadata` | GET | Get program metadata |
| `/create_project` | POST | Create a Ghidra project |
| `/list_analyzers` | GET | List available analyzers |
| `/server/status` | GET | Check Ghidra Server connection |

**[@heeen](https://github.com/heeen)** — Significant contributions including:
- Fuzzy function matching and structured diff for cross-binary comparison (#13)
- Script execution improvements and bug fixes (#12)
- New API endpoints: `save_program`, `exit_ghidra`, `delete_function`, `create_memory_block`, `run_script_inline` (#11)
- Architectural vision: annotation-driven design, UDS transport, Python bridge optimization proposals

**[@huehuehuehueing](https://github.com/huehuehuehueing)** — Significant contributions including:
- Address-space prefix support — added `<space>:<hex>` syntax (e.g., `mem:1000`, `code:ff00`) to address parsing across the entire endpoint surface, unlocking multi-space targets like embedded firmware (#84, closes #65)
- Optional `program` parameter + required-param schema fixes — made `program` optional on every endpoint with a sane currentProgram fallback, and fixed several required-vs-optional schema bugs the catalog had inherited (#92)
- Seeded #44 (data-type / enum tools) — the issue that motivated the v5.0 enum + struct enforcement layer
