# focused work on one binary set (e.g. a D2 mod) so accidental wrong-folder
# program references get rejected at the plugin layer instead of silently
# writing to the wrong binary.

# Default scope is /Mods/PD2-S12 (the diablo2 PD2 Season 12 mod folder).
# Override with -Scope or by setting $env:GHIDRA_MCP_PROJECT_FOLDER yourself
# before invoking ghidraRun.bat.
#
# Do NOT use this wrapper for deploy/benchmark runs — the regression suite
# operates on /testing/benchmark/* which would be rejected by the scope guard.
# Plain `ghidraRun.bat` (no env var) keeps the default unscoped behavior.
