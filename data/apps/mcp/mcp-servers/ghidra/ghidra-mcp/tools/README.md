# Tools Directory

Utility scripts and tooling for the Ghidra MCP Server project.

## What's here

```
tools/
├── setup/         # Project setup, build, deploy, version-bump CLI
│                  #   python -m tools.setup --help
└── (CLI utilities live in fun-doc/ now — see below)
```

## Looking for the function-documentation CLI?

Three older scripts (`scan_undocumented_functions.py`,
`scan_functions_mcp.py`, `document_function.py`) used to live here.
They were archived to
[`docs/archive/legacy-tools/`](../docs/archive/legacy-tools/) in v5.10
because **`fun-doc/` does the same job, much better**:

| What you used to run | Now run |
| --- | --- |
| `tools/scan_undocumented_functions.py` | The fun-doc dashboard's "Worker" tab, or `python fun-doc/fun_doc.py --scan` for a one-shot inventory. |
| `tools/scan_functions_mcp.py` | Same — `fun-doc/` ranks candidates continuously with proper state. |
| `tools/document_function.py --function FUN_401000` | `python fun-doc/fun_doc.py --manual --address 0x401000` (single function), or just let the worker pick up the next candidate. |

`fun-doc/` adds state persistence (`state.db`), run-history tracking
(`runs.jsonl`), parallel workers with watchdog/heartbeat, the
completeness scoring rubric, provider routing/fallback, the web
dashboard, block-reason capture, and the library-code detector — all
the things the legacy scripts couldn't do.

## Setup CLI

The `setup/` package is the actively maintained tooling. Use it for
every build/deploy/release flow:

```bash
# show all subcommands
python -m tools.setup --help

# common ones
python -m tools.setup build
python -m tools.setup preflight      --ghidra-path F:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC
python -m tools.setup deploy         --ghidra-path F:\ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC
python -m tools.setup bump-version   --new 5.10.0
python -m tools.setup verify-version
```

See [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) → **Build & Deploy** for the full
workflow including the Gradle alternative.

## Adding a tool

If you have a one-off script that genuinely doesn't fit inside
`fun-doc/`, `tools/setup/`, or `ghidra_scripts/`, drop a standalone
file here with a clear docstring and add a row to the table above.
Most of the time, though, the right home for new utility code is one
of those three existing locations.

All tools connect to Ghidra MCP Server via HTTP (default:
`http://127.0.0.1:8089`).
