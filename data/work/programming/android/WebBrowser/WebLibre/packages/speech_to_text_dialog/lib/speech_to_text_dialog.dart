/// ```dart
/// final speechDialog = SpeechToTextDialog();
///
/// // Listen for results
/// final subscription = speechDialog.textStream.listen((text) {
///   print('Recognized: $text');
/// });
///
/// // Show the dialog
/// final success = await speechDialog.showDialog(locale: 'en-US');
///
/// // Clean up when done
/// await subscription.cancel();
/// speechDialog.dispose();
/// ```
