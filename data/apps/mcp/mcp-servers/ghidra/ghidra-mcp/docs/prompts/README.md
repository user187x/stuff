# Ghidra MCP AI Workflow Prompts

Battle-tested prompts for reverse engineering binary code in Ghidra using MCP tools. Refined across thousands of functions.

## Start Here

| Goal | Prompt | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Document a function** | [FUNCTION_DOC_WORKFLOW_V5.md](FUNCTION_DOC_WORKFLOW_V5.md) | Primary workflow. 7-step process with Hungarian notation, type auditing, and verification scoring. |
| **Find undiscovered code** | [ORPHANED_CODE_DISCOVERY_WORKFLOW.md](ORPHANED_CODE_DISCOVERY_WORKFLOW.md) | Automated scanner for functions hiding in gaps between known code. |
| **Investigate data types** | [DATA_TYPE_INVESTIGATION_QUICK.md](DATA_TYPE_INVESTIGATION_QUICK.md) | Structure discovery and field analysis. |

## Function Documentation (V5 Workflow)

The V5 workflow is the current standard. It addresses every failure mode encountered in V1-V4.

**Key features:**
- Strict ordering (naming/typing BEFORE comments)
- Batch operations (`rename_variables` dict, `batch_set_comments`)
- Type audit checking actual storage types, not decompiler display types
- Built-in Hungarian notation reference
- Verification scoring via `analyze_function_completeness`

## Moved to `d2-game-exe` (2026-08-11)

Four workflows described documenting one specific corpus rather than operating
this server, and went with the D2 tooling:
`DATA_TYPE_INVESTIGATION_WORKFLOW`, `BINARY_DOCUMENTATION_ORDER`,
`CROSS_VERSION_FUNCTION_MATCHING`, `CROSS_VERSION_MATCHING_COMPREHENSIVE`.

## Archive

Earlier workflow versions (V1-V4), compact/subagent variants, and superseded reference docs are in [archive/](archive/). Use V5 for all new work.
