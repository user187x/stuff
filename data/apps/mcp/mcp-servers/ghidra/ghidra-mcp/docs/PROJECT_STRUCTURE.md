# Ghidra MCP Project Structure

This guide describes the current, maintained layout of the repository. It is a
high-level map, not a full file inventory.

## Key Directories

### `src/`

- Java source for the GUI plugin and headless server
- Annotation-scanned MCP endpoints live under `src/main/java/com/xebyte/`

### `tests/`

- Python unit, integration, and performance tests
- `tests/endpoints.json` is the maintained endpoint catalog snapshot

### `tools/`

- Python-native repo utilities
- `tools/setup/` is the supported setup/build/deploy/versioning interface

### `docs/`

- Maintained guides, prompt docs, and release notes
- Use `docs/README.md` as the entry point

### `ghidra_scripts/`

- Scripts intended to run inside Ghidra's Script Manager
- Distinct from the Python MCP bridge and external repo tooling

### `debugger/` — moved out 2026-08-11

- The standalone Python debugger server now lives in `d2-game-exe`; its
  `d2/conventions.py` made it game-side
- The bridge keeps 22 proxy tools that forward to `GHIDRA_DEBUGGER_URL`, so
  debugger support is still reachable — it is just no longer hosted here

### `d2-analysis/` — local only, never tracked

- Diablo II-specific notes, examples, outputs, and workflow material
- **Gitignored** (14,768 files on disk, 0 tracked). It is not part of this
  repo and not part of the build/deploy path; it is scratch material that
  happens to live in the working directory. Nothing here should depend on it.

## Supported Operator Workflow

The supported cross-platform operator surface is:

- `python -m tools.setup preflight`
- `python -m tools.setup ensure-prereqs`
- `python -m tools.setup build`
- `python -m tools.setup deploy`
- `python -m tools.setup start-ghidra`
- `python -m tools.setup run-tests`
- `python -m tools.setup bump-version --new X.Y.Z`

Do not add new documentation that points users at removed wrapper-script
workflows.

## Quick Navigation

| Task | Location |
|------|----------|
| Install and deploy | `python -m tools.setup ...` in the repo root |
| Run the MCP bridge | `uv run bridge-mcp-ghidra` (or `python -m bridge_mcp_ghidra`) |
| Read release notes | `docs/releases/` |
| Read prompt docs | `docs/prompts/` |
| Run Python tests | `tests/` |
| Work on Java plugin code | `src/main/java/com/xebyte/` |
| Run Ghidra scripts | `ghidra_scripts/` |

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep this file aligned with the real top-level repo layout.
- Prefer category-level descriptions over stale file-by-file inventories.
- Historical cleanup plans belong in archival/project-management docs, not here.
