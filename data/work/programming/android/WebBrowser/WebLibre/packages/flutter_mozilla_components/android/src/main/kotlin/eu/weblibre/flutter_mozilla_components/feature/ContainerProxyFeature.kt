     * Site assignments are kept out of the seed unless
     * [canReopenAssignedSites]. They are the one part of a snapshot the
     * extension enforces by *cancelling* a navigation, and it does so without
     * consulting `store.isReady()` — so a seed carrying them blocks loads from
     * the first request. Cancelling is only half of that feature; the other
     * half is Dart reopening the URL in the container it belongs to, off
     * `onContainerSiteAssignment`. Where that half is missing — the headless
     * paths, which run `ensureExternalComponents` with a `NoopBinaryMessenger`
     * — the cancel is a navigation with nothing left to carry it anywhere, i.e.
     * a blank page the user cannot get past on a profile that has assignments
     * but no proxies at all. A process that does have Dart keeps enforcing
     * them, so the assignment still holds through the window before the first
