/**
 * Which sessions must not record browsing history ("Exclude from History" /
 * incognito container).
 *
 * WebLibre's container membership lives in Dart, so the decision is replicated
 * here as a snapshot of tab ids and consulted by [TabScopedHistoryDelegate] —
 * the delegate each engine session runs — at record time. Keying on the tab is
 * what makes the feature work for containers *without* cookie isolation: those
 * share the default Gecko context, so a contextId can't tell their visits apart,
 * while the session that produced the visit always can.
 *
 * Resolution, in order:
 *  1. [excludedTabIds] — the replicated answer for a tab WebLibre knows about.
 *  2. [excludedContextIds] — the container's Gecko contextual identity. Covers
 *     cookie-isolated containers before the first snapshot lands (cold start,
 *     and the headless external path where no Flutter engine ever attaches).
 *  3. A provisional mark ([markProvisional]) — a tab that exists natively before
 *     WebLibre has a row for it: one just created in an excluded container, or
 *     one an excluded session opened via `window.open`. Honored only while the
 *     tab is missing from [knownTabIds], i.e. until the snapshot that covers it
 *     arrives and answers authoritatively.
 *
 * Ambiguity resolves to "excluded": a dropped visit is recoverable by revisiting
 * the page, a leaked one is not.
